Very useful for dynamically generated scripts or scripts of similar purpose and definition (e.g. database migration scripts, routing modules, etc.).\n\n## Installation ##\n\n    npm install requiredir\n\n## Testing ##\n\nThe requiredir module has unit tests built around it than can be used to verify the package before usage.  The tests are written with the Mocha and Should modules and running the below command will import such.  \n\n     npm test requiredir\n\nrequiredir's tests are compatible with Node.js 0.6 and higher. \n\n## Usage ##\n\nOnce the package has been installed using `npm`, using the module is very simple as shown below.\n\n```javascript\nvar requiredir = require(\"requiredir\")\n    , imports = requiredir(\"./routes\");\n\nconsole.log(\"Number of imports: \" + imports.length);\nconsole.log(\"Modules can be accessed as properties to the imports variable: \" + imports.myRoutes.name);\nconsole.log(\"Modules can also be accessed by Array to access them in order of importing: \" + imports.toArray().length);\n```\n\n## Contributors ##\n* James Eggers\n* [Joshua Poehls](https://github.com/jpoehls)\n\n\n## License ##\n\n(MIT) \n\nCopyright (c) 2012 James Eggers\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
